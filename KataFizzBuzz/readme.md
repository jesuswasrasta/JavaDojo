FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

#Rules
## First rule
You can write NO production code except to pass a failing test case.
##Second rule
You can only write enough of a test case to demonstrate a failure (compiler errors are failures).
##Third rule
You can only write enough production code to pass the currently failing test case.

Red - make a failing test case
Green - make the test pass
Blue - refactor
